# To Start

The aim of this project is to create a real estate renting API using following technologies:

- OpenAPI3.
- Akka-http.
- Angular.

# Steps

1. Define what this API can be used for.
2. Create the API description using OpenAPI 3. 
    It consists of a yaml file describig / defining the API with general informations, availble paths and operations... 
    [The OpenAPI map](http://openapi-map.apihandyman.io/?version=3.0) provides a very interessting shemas and a complete explanaision of the file structure.
    The [official documentation](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) is also very usefull.
3. Code generation scala-akka-http-server.

For steps 2 and 3, I used the [swaggerhub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/home) online.

4. Complete the generated code.
